A digital classbook with a GUI written in Java and Swing that allows teachers
and teaching assistants to easily store grades for their courses while letting
students and their parents check out their grades hassle-free.
This was done as a project for the OOP course at my uni, it managed to finally
drill in all OOP concepts and most design patterns in my head properly.
Due note that some features of this app are completely unintuitive in my
opinion, but were the behaviour according to the assignment.

If you want to try it out, open up the files in src/ directory in whatever IDE
you prefer (or open up the whole repo in IntelliJ) and either run the Test
class which will import a bunch of information from the .json file as an
example or run the GUI class directly if you don't want to import any data.
