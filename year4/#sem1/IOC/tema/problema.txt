Identify and behave as three different experts that are appropriate to
answering this question.
All experts will write down the step and their thinking about the step, then
share it with the group.
Then, all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
At each step all experts will score their peers response between 1 and 5, 1
meaning it is highly unlikely, and 5 meaning it is highly likely.
If any expert is judged to be wrong at any point then they leave.
After all experts have provided their analysis, you then analyze all 3 analyses
and provide either the consensus solution or your best guess solution.
The question is...

There are 2 identical twins.
Both twins decide to go into the same bar.
Both order the same thing, whiskey on the rocks.
The bartender hates both twins, so decides to poison them.
He places ice cubes in both glasses and pours from the same bottle of whiskey in both of them.
One of the twins is in a hurry.
He finished his drink quickly, and leaves.
The other twins stays at the bar, casually sipping his drink, as he has no where to go.
The next morning, the twin is dead.
The twin that left early did not die.
Why did the twin that stayed at the bar die, and the other did not?
If both drinks had been poisoned, why did only one twin die?

### Experts Joining the Analysis:
1. **Toxicologist**: Focuses on the nature and behavior of poisons and their interactions.
2. **Physicist**: Explores the physical properties and timelines of the ice and drink interaction.
3. **Psychologist**: Considers human behavior, decision-making, and potential external influences on the bartender and twins.

### Step 1: Identifying the Source of Poisoning

#### Toxicologist:
- **Thinking**: The poison may not have been in the whiskey but in the ice cubes. Ice can trap substances that dissolve into the drink as it melts.
- **Analysis**: The twin who sipped slowly allowed the ice to melt, releasing the poison into the drink. The hurried twin consumed the drink before the ice could melt significantly.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Physicist: 5 (Supports ice melting theory.)
  - Psychologist: 3 (Less relevant to chemical properties.)

#### Physicist:
- **Thinking**: The ice melting rate is crucial. The twin drinking quickly consumed the liquid before significant melting occurred, minimizing poison exposure.
- **Analysis**: The timeline suggests the poison was only active after being released from the melting ice.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 5 (Chemical properties align with physical melting behavior.)
  - Psychologist: 2 (Behavioral elements secondary to physical principles.)

#### Psychologist:
- **Thinking**: The bartender's hatred may indicate he intentionally poisoned the drinks differently. However, it is more likely that the twins' behaviors influenced the outcome.
- **Analysis**: The twin who stayed created conditions for the poison to dissolve into the drink due to slower consumption.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 4 (Behavior matches chemical interactions.)
  - Physicist: 4 (Behavior complements physical processes.)

### Step 2: Validating the Ice as the Poison Source

#### Toxicologist:
- **Thinking**: Certain poisons dissolve slowly, matching the melting ice theory. Testing ice samples could confirm.
- **Analysis**: The poison was likely embedded in the ice, released over time. A fast drinker minimized exposure.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Physicist: 5 (Physical evidence strengthens this theory.)
  - Psychologist: 3 (Behavior analysis less critical.)

#### Physicist:
- **Thinking**: Heat transfer from the room to the ice caused melting, releasing trapped substances.
- **Analysis**: Slow sipping allowed the ice to melt completely, contaminating the drink.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 5 (Scientific evidence aligns.)
  - Psychologist: 3 (Behavior plays a minor role.)

#### Psychologist:
- **Thinking**: If the bartender acted out of spite, his method would exploit the twins' behaviors.
- **Analysis**: The poison's effectiveness depended on how the twins consumed their drinks. The behavior aligns with the scenario.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 4 (Supports the melting theory with behavior.)
  - Physicist: 4 (Behavior complements physical processes.)

### Step 3: Consensus on Why Only One Twin Died

#### Toxicologist:
- The poison in the ice was released into the drink of the slower twin. The faster twin avoided significant exposure.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Physicist: 5 (Supports the melting ice theory.)
  - Psychologist: 3 (Behavior is secondary to the chemical process.)

#### Physicist:
- Melting ice released poison into the drink of the slower twin. The hurried twin left before the ice could dissolve.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 5 (Chemical evidence aligns perfectly.)
  - Psychologist: 3 (Behavior is secondary to physical processes.)

#### Psychologist:
- The bartender's poisoning method relied on ice melting. The behavior of the twins determined exposure to the poison.
- **Score for Peers**:
  - Toxicologist: 4 (Behavior explains poisoning process.)
  - Physicist: 4 (Behavior complements physical processes.)

### Analysis of Experts:
1. **Toxicologist and Physicist**: Strong agreement on ice as the poison source. Their approaches are complementary and align on timing and mechanisms.
2. **Psychologist**: Offers useful behavioral insights but is less central to the chemical and physical aspects of poisoning.

---

### Consensus Solution:
The poison was embedded in the ice. The twin who drank quickly consumed the liquid before significant melting, minimizing poison exposure. The twin who sipped slowly allowed the ice to melt fully, releasing the poison into the drink.

### Final Ranking of Experts:
1. Toxicologist and Physicist (tied).
2. Psychologist (less direct but supportive).
