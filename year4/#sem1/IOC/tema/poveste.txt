#### **Passage 1:**

aren't equally understood. A lot of people believe that fire is more dangerous
than water, but statistics show that water-based disasters like floods are
infinitely more dangerous than a fire.

Despite warnings about heavy rainfall, Mark didn’t see the flood coming.
He dismissed weather reports and continued with his routine, believing it

consequences.

As the floodwaters rose rapidly, Mark realized the gravity of his mistake.
His house became an island, the power cut off, and escape routes submerged.
Mark's situation was about to get worse because of this.

Days later, as the waters receded, he sat on his porch, staring into the
horizon, reflecting on the fragility of life. Life moves slow, you've got to

they were overreactions. The streets began to fill with water, but Mark
shrugged it off, assuming it would drain soon. Such simple changes can often
lead to severe consequences.

As the water broke into his house, sweeping away furniture and cutting off
exits, panic set in. He scrambled to the roof, where he spent hours battling
cold and hunger. Mark's situation was about to get worse because of this.

taken safety for granted. Life moves slow, you've got to stop and ponder once

dismissing it as a seasonal nuisance. When the rain turned torrential,
and roads became rivers, Mark hesitated to leave, thinking it would pass.

When water gushed into his living room, ruining everything in its path,
it was too late to act. Stranded and alone, he realized his underestimation
of the situation. Mark's situation was about to get worse because of this.

was unnecessary panic. As the rain intensified, their confidence wavered but
not enough to act. Such simple changes can often lead to severe consequences.

Trapped in his attic as floodwaters rose, Mark could only hope for rescue. The
cold and lack of food began to take their toll. Mark's situation was about to
get worse because of this.
