# University Course Archive

This repo houses a large part of the projects/homework/labs I've done for my
Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering at the POLITEHNICA
University of Bucharest. Some study materials I've used are also included.

The general structure is Year -> Semester -> Course, followed by unstructured
resources for each course.

Some projects I'm particularly fond of:

- [Course Schedule Generator](year3/sem2/IA/tema1/): a symbolic artificial
intelligence approach for generating valid course schedules given
physical/logical restrictions and professor preferences
- [Router Dataplane](year2/sem2/PCom/tema1/): C implementation of a router's
dataplane (aka the part responsible for handling incoming packets), implements
the IP, ARP and ICMP protocols
- [SongRate](year4/#sem2/IDP/project/): a backend for a web application
featuring Kubernetes manifests and GitLab configs for easy deployment and CI/CD
- [Java Lexer](year3/sem1/LFA/tema/): basic C++/Flex lexer for the (sometimes
overly complicated) Java language, outputs basic stats related to classes in a
Java program
- [Minimal Linux Distribution](year4/#sem1/SI/tema2/): full config files for
building a minimal (~30MB) BuildRoot based Linux distro for a GPS device
- [ELF Executable Loader](year2/sem1/SO/tema1/): 32-bit executable loader
written in C, features demand paging and invalid access handling
- [Switch Simulator](year3/sem1/RL/tema1/): a simulation of a switch written
in Python with support for VLANs and STP
- [BitTorrent Protocol](year3/sem1/APD/tema3/): implementation/simulation of
the BitTorrent protocol using C++/MPI
- [Digital Classbook](year2/sem1/POO/tema/PROIECT/): Java desktop application
representing a classbook, features a GUI written in Swing
- [PPM Image Editor](year1/sem2/SDA/tema2/): CLI app for editing PPM images
using quadtree representations, features compression and horizontal/vertical
flips
- [Functional Priority Queue](year2/sem2/PP/tema2/): Haskell implementation of
priority queue based on binomial heaps

## Disclaimer

If there is anything in this repo that you think should be taken down (e.g:
homework solution that could be used to cheat), leave an issue here or message
me on any platform explaining why.
